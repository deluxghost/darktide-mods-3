# seroperson's Warhammer 40k Darktide mods

Hello and welcome to my Darktide mods repository.

- [FilterTrash](#filtertrash)

## FilterTrash

Filters Brunt's store weapon items to get rid of unusable trash. Currently it 
supports:

- Filtering based on base item level (0-380).
- Filtering based on every available item stat (0-80%).
- Disabling filtering if item has unlearned trait.

Relics are always visible because it takes not so much time to check them 
manually.
